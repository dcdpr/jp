# Getting Started

Jean-Pierre is a command-line toolkit designed to integrate seamlessly into your
existing workflow, providing a flexible and powerful pair-programming
experience with LLMs.

JP is distributed as a single-binary executable, for different platforms. You
can install it following one of the methods described in the [installation
guide](./installation.md).

Once installed, you can run the `jp` command to start using JP. See the [usage
guide](./usage.md) for more information.

Check out the [case studies](./case-studies.md) to see JP in action. To find out
what features JP offers, see the [features](./features.md) section.

Once you're familiar with JP, you can explore the [configuration
options](./configuration.md) to customize your experience.
