# RFD NNN: TITLE

- **Status**: Draft
- **Authors**: AUTHOR
- **Date**: DATE

## Summary

One to three sentences stating the decision. A reader should understand what
was decided without reading further.

## Context

The forces at play: technical constraints, project needs, team experience,
existing patterns. State facts, not opinions. What makes this decision
necessary now?

## Decision

State the decision clearly. "We will use X" or "We will adopt Y." Be
specific enough to act on.

## Consequences

What follows from this decision — positive, negative, and neutral. What
becomes easier? What becomes harder? What trade-offs are we accepting?
