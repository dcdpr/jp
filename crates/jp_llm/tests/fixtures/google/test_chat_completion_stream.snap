It's a simple input, so the goal is equally straightforward – a helpful and appropriate response acknowledging the interaction. The core task is now in responding appropriately.\n\n\n**Refining the Response**\n\nI've determined the best response to the test message as \"Hello! I received your test message. How can I help you today?\". This balances acknowledgment with a prompt for further interaction. My next step is to prepare it for implementation, making it ready for a real-time interaction.\n\n\n",
