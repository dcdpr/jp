It's imperative that I access and present the details from the most recent tool execution. Specifically, I'm pulling the results stemming from the \"Testing tool call\". My memory indicates I ran a `print(default_api.run_me(bar = \"foo\"))` and the output returned was `{\"run_me_response\": {\"content\": \"The secret code is: 42\"}}`.
