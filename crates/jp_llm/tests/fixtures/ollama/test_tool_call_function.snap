The function signature shows it's defined with <nil> for parameters, so it doesn't require any arguments. But the user wants me to provide arguments. Wait, maybe the function can accept arguments even if they're not specified? Or perhaps the user just wants me to call it without any arguments since the tool doesn't require any. \n\nSince the function doesn't have any parameters, I should call it without arguments. The user might be testing if I can execute the function correctly. I need to make sure I follow the directive to use the 'run_me' function and not ask for more context. So the correct action is to generate a tool call for 'run_me' with an empty arguments object.\n",
