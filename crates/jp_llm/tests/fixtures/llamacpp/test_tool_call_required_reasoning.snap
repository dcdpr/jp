The response came back as \"working!\", which is a positive sign. Now, I need to let the user know that the tool executed successfully. Since the user might be testing if the tool works, I should confirm the execution and maybe ask if they need anything else. I should keep the response friendly and open-ended to encourage further interaction. Let me check if there's anything else needed, but since the user didn't specify, a simple confirmation should suffice.",
