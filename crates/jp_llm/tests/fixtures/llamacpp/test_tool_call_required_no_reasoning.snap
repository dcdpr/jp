The response came back as \"working!\", which is a positive sign.\n\nNow, the user hasn't given a new query yet, but I need to be ready to respond. Since the previous interaction was about running a tool, maybe they want to know if the tool worked or what the next steps are. I should confirm that the tool executed successfully and perhaps ask if they need anything else. I should keep the tone friendly and helpful, making sure they know I'm here to assist further. Let me make sure my response is clear and concise.",
