The message \"Test message\" is straightforward, so I need to interpret their intent clearly. \n\nGiven the lack of details, they’re likely testing the AI’s responsiveness or checking if the system is working. The most logical response would be to confirm their test was successful and invite them to share their actual needs. \n\nI should keep the reply friendly and open-ended to encourage further interaction. No need for complex analysis here—just a quick, supportive acknowledgment that addresses their probable goal: confirming the AI is active and ready to help.\n",
