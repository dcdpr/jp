However, I need more information about what you'd like to test.\n\nLooking at the available function `run_me`, it requires:\n- **bar** (required): Can be either the string `\"foo\"` or an array `[\"foo\", \"bar\"]`\n- **foo** (optional): A string parameter with a default value of `\"foo\"`\n\nWhat would you like me to do? Would you like me to:\n1. Call `run_me` with `bar=\"foo\"`?\n2. Call `run_me` with `bar=[\"foo\", \"bar\"]`?\n3. Something else?\n\nLet me know your preference and I'll execute the test!",
