However, I need to know what you'd like to test. \n\nLooking at the available tool, I have access to `run_me` which requires:\n- **bar** (required): either \"foo\" or [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\n- **foo** (optional): a string value (defaults to \"foo\")\n\nWould you like me to call this function? If so, please let me know:\n1. What value for **bar** would you like? (\"foo\" or [\"foo\", \"bar\"])\n2. What value for **foo** would you like? (optional, defaults to \"foo\")\n\nOr if you'd like me to just make a test call with default/basic values, I can do that too!",
