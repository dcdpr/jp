# We're using unstable options in e.g. `.rustfmt.toml` that require a nightly compiler. However, the
# project has the `unstable-features` lint set to `warn` (and `deny` on CI), so we can't
# accidentally use unstable features that would not work on the stable release.
#
# When releasing a new version of the binary, we build it with the stable compiler.
