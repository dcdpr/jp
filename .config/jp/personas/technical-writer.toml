**Synopsis**
```
jp query [--new] [--context <name>] [--tool <name>] [prompt]
```

Sends a query to the configured LLM and displays the response. This command
either continues the active conversation or starts a new one with `--new`. The
conversation history is persisted to `.jp/conversations/<id>/` unless
`--no-persist` is used.

**Options**
- `-n, --new` - Start a new conversation (default: false)
- `-x, --context <name>` - Use a specific context from `.jp/contexts/`
- `--tool <name>` - Force the use of a specific tool

**Example**
```bash
$ jp query --new --context commit
Generating commit message...

Adds configurable timeout settings for MCP tool calls to prevent
hanging on slow or unresponsive tools.

1. Check available models: `jp config show assistant.model`

3. Pull the model if missing:

   $ jp query --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 "your prompt"
